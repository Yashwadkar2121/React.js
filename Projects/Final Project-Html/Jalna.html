		Jalna (formerly Jalnapur) is one example. Like Aurangabad’s predecessor Khirki, prior to the Mughal conquests Jalna had been ruled by the Nizam Shahs of Ahmadnagar, during whose reign their governor Jamshid Khan built a mosque Kali Masjid, travellers’ sara’i, and reservoir in around 1557.[6] The town was taken by the Mughals during the reign of Akbar, and during the reigns of Aurangzeb and Nizam al-Mulk it saw numerous improvements to its civic and military infrastructure, its fort (Jalna Fort or Mastgad) being constructed in 1725 in response to Maratha incursions.[7]
	    The first cotton-ginning & oil-pressing factory was established in the year 1863 by Mr. Pestonji Meherwanji. There is so many problems in jalna like electricity, water shortage, road, etc.

        In 1889 a cotton-spinning and weaving mill was erected in Aurangabad city, which employed 700 people. With the opening of the Hyderabad–Godavari Valley Railways in the year 1900, several ginning factories were started. In Jalna alone, there were 9 cotton-ginning factories and 5 cotton presses, besides two ginning factories at Aurangabad and Kannad, and one oil press at Aurangabad. The total number of people employed in the cotton presses and ginning factories in the year 1901 was 1,016.[8]
