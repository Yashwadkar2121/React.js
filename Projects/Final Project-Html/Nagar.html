		Ahmednagar is a city in the Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, India, about 120 km northeast of Pune and 114 km from Aurangabad. It is the seat of its namesake district.[clarification needed] The official name is now changed to Ahilyadevi Holkar Nagar by the state government.[3] In July 2023, deputy chief minister Devendra Fadanavis announced the name of the city would be changed to Ahilya Nagar. [4]

        Ahmednagar has several dozen buildings and sites from the Nizam Shahi period.[5] Ahmednagar Fort, once considered almost impregnable, was used by the British to house Jawaharlal Nehru (the first prime minister of India) and other Indian Nationalists before Indian independence. A few rooms there have been converted to a museum. During his confinement by the British at Ahmednagar Fort in 1944, Nehru wrote book The Discovery of India.[6] Ahmednagar is home to the Indian Armoured Corps Centre & School (ACC&S), the Mechanised Infantry Regimental Centre (MIRC), the Vehicle Research and Development Establishment (VRDE) and the Controllerate of Quality Assurance Vehicles (CQAV). Training and recruitment for the Indian Army Armoured Corps takes place at the ACC&S.[7]

        Ahmednagar is a relatively small town and shows less development than the nearby western Maharashtra cities of Mumbai and Pune. Ahmednagar is home to 19 sugar factories and is also the birthplace of the cooperative movement.[citation needed] Due to scarce rainfall, the city often suffers from drought. Marathi is the primary language for daily-life communication. The city administration has recently published a plan of developing the city by year 2031.[8]

        Ahmednagar took its name from Ahmad Nizam Shah I, who founded the town in 1494[9] on the site of a battlefield where he won a battle against superior Bahamani forces.[10] It was close to the site of the village of Bhingar.[10] With the breakup of the Bahmani Sultanate, Ahmad established a new sultanate in Ahmednagar, also known as Nizam Shahi dynasty.[11]
        Ahmednagar will be renamed after Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde announced at an event celebrating the 298th birth anniversary of the Maratha queen at her birthplace Chondi in the Jamkhed taluka of Ahmednagar district on Wednesday. “The state government has decided to rename Ahmednagar as Ahilyadevi Nagar. Ahilyadevi is known for her Himalayan works. Her name will bring honour to the district,” CM Shinde said, as he made the announcement.“Ahilyadevi put forth lessons on ideal statecraft through her acts. References to her administrative acumen are made even today. She left an enriched heritage of a strong and able administrative framework. We try to follow in her footsteps,” Shinde said.
