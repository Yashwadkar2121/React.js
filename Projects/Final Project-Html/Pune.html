		Pune <(Marathi: [puɳe] i; English: /ˈpuːnə/), previously known as Poona, (the official name from 1818 until 1978)[15][16] is a city in Maharashtra state in the Deccan plateau in Western India. It is the administrative headquarters of the Pune district, and of Pune division. The city of Pune is part of Pune Metropolitan Region.[17] Pune is one of the largest IT hubs in India.[18][19] It is also one of the most important automobile and manufacturing hubs of India.[20] Pune is often referred to as "Oxford of the East" because of highly regarded educational institutions in the city.[21][22][23] It has been ranked "the most liveable city in India" several times.[24][25]

       Pune at different points in time has been ruled by the Rashtrakuta dynasty, Ahmadnagar Sultanate, the Mughals, and the Adil Shahi dynasty. In the 18th century, the city was a part of Maratha Empire, and the seat of the Peshwas, the prime ministers of the Maratha Empire.[26] Many historical landmarks like Pataleshwar caves, Shaniwarwada, Shinde Chhatri, and Vishrambaug Wada date to this era. Historical sites from different eras are dotted across the city.

       Pune has historically been a major cultural centre, with important figures like Dnyaneshwar, Shivaji, Tukaram, Mahadev Govind Ranade, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, Savitribai Phule, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Tarabai Shinde, Dhondo Keshav Karve, and Pandita Ramabai doing their life's work in Pune City or in an area that falls in Pune Metropolitan Region. Pune was a major centre of resistance to British Raj, with people like Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar playing leading roles in struggle for Indian independence in their times.

       Etymology
       Further information: Puneri
       The earliest reference to Pune is an inscription on a Rashtrakuta Dynasty copper plate dated 937 CE, which refers to the town as Punya-Vishaya, meaning 'sacred news'.[27] By the 13th century, it had come to be known as Punawadi.[28]

       During the Rashtrakuta dynasty, the city was referred to as Punnaka and Punyapur. The copper plates of 758 and 768 CE show that the Yadava dynasty had renamed the city Punakavishaya  and Punya Vishaya. 'Vishaya' means land, and 'Punaka' and 'Punya' mean holy. The city was known as Kasbe Pune when under the command of Maratha king Shivaji's father, Shahaji. Mughal emperor Aurangzeb renamed the central part of the old city Muhiyabad (the only divergent naming) some time between 1703 and 1705 in memory of his great-grandson Muhi-ul-Milan, who died there. The name Muhiyabad was lost soon after Aurangzeb's death.[15] Anglicized to Poona in 1857 by the English during British rule, the city's name was changed back to Pune in 1978.

       Early and Medieval Period

       The circular Nandi mandapa at the Pataleshwar cave temple built in the Rashtrakuta era (753-982)
       Copper plates dated 858 and 868 CE show that by the 9th century an agricultural settlement known as Punnaka existed at the location of the modern Pune. The plates indicate that this region was ruled by the Rashtrakuta dynasty. The Pataleshwar rock-cut temple complex was built during this era.[29] Pune was part of the territory ruled by the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri from the 9th century to 1327. Pune was under control of Muslim leaders till the late 16th century.[citation needed]

       The Maratha Empire
       Main article: Maratha Empire
       Pune was part of the Jagir (fiefdom) granted by the Nizamshahi (Ahmadnagar Sultanate) to Maloji Bhosale in 1599.[30] Maloji Bhosale passed on Jagir of Pune to his son Shahaji Bhosale, who gave it to his wife Jijabai and appointed Dadoji Konddeo to help Jijabai in administration of Jagir. Jijabai and Shahaji's son, Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire, was born at the fort of Shivneri, about 90 km from Pune.[31]

      After the destruction of the town in raids by the Adil Shahi dynasty in 1630 and again between 1636 and 1647, Dadoji Konddeo oversaw the reconstruction of the town. The Lal Mahal was commissioned in 1631 and construction was completed in 1640 AD.[27] Shivaji spent his young years at the Lal Mahal. Jijabai is said to have commissioned the building of the Kasba Ganapati temple. The Ganesha idol consecrated at this temple has been regarded as the presiding deity (Gramadevata) of the city.[32]

       From 1703 to 1705, towards the end of the 27-year-long Mughal–Maratha Wars, the village was occupied by Aurangzeb and its name was changed temporarily to Muhiyabad.[15][33] This name was abandoned and reverted back to its original name soon after Aurangzib's death.
