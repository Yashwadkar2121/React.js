	<p>
		India, near the confluence of the river Krishna and its tributary, the Venna.[2] The city was established in the 16th century and was the seat of the Chhatrapati of Maratha Empire, Shahu I. It is the headquarters of Satara Tehsil, as well as the Satara District. The city gets its name from the seven forts (Sat-Tara) which are around the city. The city is known as a Soldier's city as well as Pensioner's city.
        History
        The first known Muslim ruling of the Deccan took place in 1296. In 1636, the Nizam Shahi dynasty came to an end. In 1663, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj conquered Parali and Satara fort. After the death of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Shahu Shivaji, heir apparent to the Maratha Empire, captured by Mughals when he was only seven years old, remained their prisoner till the death of his father in 1700. The Dowager Maharani Tarabai proclaimed his younger half-brother, and her son, Shahu Sambhaji as Chhatrapati Maharaj under her regency. Mughals released Shahu under certain preconditions in 1707, so that Marathas would face an internal war for the throne. Shahu returned to the Maratha Empire and claimed his inheritance. Aurangzeb's son Muhammad Azam Shah conquered Satara fort Ajinkyatara after a 6-month siege, later won by Parshuram Pratinidhi in 1706. In 1708, Chattrapati Shahu, the son of Chattrapati Sambhaji, was crowned at the Satara fort. The direct descendants of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj continue to live in Satara. Chattrapati Udayanraje Bhonsle is the 13th descendant of Shivaji.[3]
        Shadow government was established during Quit India movement in Satara.[4]

       Satara1
       Satara is located at 17.68°N 73.98°E.[5] It lies in the Satara District.[6] Satara city is surrounded by seven mountains. Satara lies on the slope of Ajinkyatara fort.[7] It lies on the western side of the Deccan Plateau. Pune (110 KM) , Sangli (121 KM), Kolhapur (122 KM) and Solapur (263 KM) are the main cities close to Satara.[6] The city is surrounded by the tehsils of Koregaon on the West, Karad (51 KM) and Patan on the South, Jawali on the East and Wai on the North.[6]

       National Highway 48 (formerly National Highway 4) passes through Satara, between Karad and Khandala.[8] Kaas Plateau, a valley of flowers, is situated 25 km away from Satara .[9]

       The Satara District experiences earthquakes of minor magnitudes. the epicenter of these earthquakes are scattered in Patan Taluka.[7]

       Satara is famous for the Kaas Plateau, Thoseghar, and a lot of natural sites present in the vicinity of the city. Kass Plateau has been awarded as a UNESCO's World Heritage Site (WHS). In the monsoon months, the Kaas Pathar, as it is locally known, transforms into a wildflower wonderland. More particularly so in September when vivid shades of pink balsams, yellow Smithia flowers, and blue utricularias carpet the vast grasslands. It’s a must-visit for serious botanists, amateur photographers to witness the spectrum of Western Ghats monsoon montane grasslands flora, some of which are rare and endangered.[10]
